The .xco files are kept under version control here so that the project
can easily be re-downloaded from git.

However, ISE has an annoying habit of re-writing the timestamp of the
.xco files which clutters the staging area. One workaround for this is
to run:

git update-index --skip-worktree *.xco

Then git will ignore any changes to the .xco files. If you ever need git
to un-ignore one of these files, then you can run:

git update-index --no-skip-worktree <file>
git add -p <file>
git update-index --skip-worktree <file>
